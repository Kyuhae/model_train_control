#To compile and upload arduino code using catkin_make:
#as usual, catkin_make first
catkin_make

#then, upload to arduino using:
model_train_control_arduino_firmware_mtca-upload
(and maybe catkin_make model_train_control_arduino_firmware_mtca  before that)

#note: ensure that there are no nodes or processes writing serial info to arduino while uploading, and vice-versa
